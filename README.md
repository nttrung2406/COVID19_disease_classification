The aims of the project are:

+ Implement an CNN model with 5 layers to predict COVID19, PNEUMONIA.

+ Convert pytorch model to ONNX model and TENSORRT to boost the inference speed using NVIDIA gpu.

+ Comparing among Pytorch, ONNX and TENSORRT model

**Prerequisite:**

+ Must have NVIDA GPU

**Installation:**

Install TENSORRT can follow this direction:
